# Ascii Animation



## Usage
1. Add a sprite by entering a value 2D array of strings. There must be a valid from coordinate entered.
2. A valid coordinate is entered as: Row,Column
3. Sprite selected can be moved to a different starting position by changint its from coordinate.
4. Enter a to coordinate for a sprite selected and it will go from its position to the position specified
5. A sprite can move either by row and column, column and row, diagonal/optimal (developing), or teleport (developing).
6. Delay speed affects how fast a sprite moved to get to a position; it cannot be less than 1 millisecond.
7. Rotation direction, for now, is either clockwise 90 degrees or counterclockwise 90 degrees.
## Developing
1. Create functionality for making a sprite with images associated with it.
2. Create an option to save and load a sprite with all of its abilities specified.
3. Allow movement options teleport, optimal, or diagonal.
4. Create a physics engine to handle this 2D environment. Then create a tool to make rigid body projectiles.
